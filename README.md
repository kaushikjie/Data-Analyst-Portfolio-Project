This data exploration project done personally by me and this project is about exploring the covid-19 (covid deaths and covid vaccinations)data such as: How many persons were infected in this pandemic 
and how many deaths were there in relation to total population of the location or continent and death percentage over the population of the location, also I have shown the use of CTE and Temp tables and joining with another table named as Covid Vaccinations.
I also have showed the cases that was new on dailhy basis and also the deaths that occured on daily basis and their total in relation to the location.
I enjoyed doing this project and I leaned a lot about what could be a common mistake that can occur while doing this kind of data exploration and also how to encounter that problem.
Although this project was awesome to complete.
